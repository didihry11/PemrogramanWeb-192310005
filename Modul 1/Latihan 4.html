        <p>
            There’s no question that software programming is a hot career right now.
            The <span class="highlight">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> projects 21 percent growth 
            for programming jobs from 2018 to 2028, which is more than four times the average for all occupations.
            What’s more, the median annual pay for a software programmer is about $106,000,
            which is nearly three times the median pay for all U.S. workers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies,
            and types of software require knowing and understanding different programming languages—
            and it’s often beneficial to know multiple languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming
            can be a daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior programming experience.

            The <a href="#">Master of Science in Computer Science Align program</a> at Northeastern University 
            is specifically designed for students who want to transition into computer science from another field of study.
